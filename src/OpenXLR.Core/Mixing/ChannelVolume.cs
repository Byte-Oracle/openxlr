/// volume of its own, so the channel volume is folded into that number: the
/// stream carries the send level times the channel volume, times the mix
/// master where the mix has no desktop master of its own. Audio takes the
/// same path it always did, with no added latency.
///
/// On XLR 1, XLR 2 and Aux In it comes after the interface's gain or Aux In
/// level and after the input's plugin chain, which it leaves alone; it is a
/// level for the mixes, whatever source the strip is bound to. The Wave XLR
/// Pro's direct microphone path to its jacks is hardware and does not pass
/// through a send, so it does not follow the channel volume. The channel's
/// sink is never used for this either. It is held at full desktop volume,
/// and the sweep puts it back when anything else moves it.
